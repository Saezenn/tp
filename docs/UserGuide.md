ClubMembersContacts (CMC) is an application designed to empower EXCO members of the School of Computing's CCAs in

- You can track tasks assigned to each member to track their completion.
- You can schedule interview times with your applicants.
- You can find members or applicants easily through the `find` commands.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Q: How do I see tasks of a different member?<br/>
A: You have to use the `viewt` or `viewtask` method to view the tasks allocated to another member.  
For example, if your window is currently on another member's task, use `viewt 3` to view the tasks of the member at
`MEMBER_INDEX` 3. Click [here](#418-viewing-all-tasks-allocated-to-a-member--viewtask-or-viewt) for more details on the
`viewtask` command. <br/><br/>

Q: How do I transfer my data to another person or computer?<br/>
A: This application saves the data of your applicants and members in the ./data/addressbook.json file. You can send the
file to the other person or computer, and overwrite the empty addressbook.json with the addressbook.json file of your choice. <br/><br/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **CAUTION:**

If the addressbook.json file is invalid or has any formatting errors, the program might not start up. Please make sure
that the addressbook.json file used is **correct and accurate.**

## 6. Common Mistakes
These are some common mistakes that you might make while using our application.

1. Problem : I can't seem to add an interview time, the error says that the input date is invalid. Why? <br/><br/>
Answer: Please make sure that the month or date has 2 digits in them. For example, January will have to be `01` and not `1`. If you are trying to cancel the interview scheduled, ensure that nothing is capitalised in `cancel` as it is case-sensitive.<br/><br/>
2. Problem : I am trying to delete a certain member off the member list. However, it seems to be deleting the wrong member. Why? <br/><br/>
Answer: The `INDEX` used will have to be the current index shown on the screen. If you are deleting the wrong member, make sure you are following the correct index shown currently shown on the screen, and not an index from a previous view. You can refer to [here](#413-viewing-members--viewmembers-or-viewm) to view the entire list of members again.<br/><br/>
3. Problem : I can't seem to see the full interview time. How can I fix this? <br/><br/>
Answer: On start-up, the resolution of the window may not be optimal for your screen size and the interview time may be cut off as a result. To fix this, you may readjust the dimensions of the CMC window by dragging the corners of the window, or maximising the view by clicking the button on the top right hand corner of the window. <br/><br/>
